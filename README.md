## ✍️ Some rules of submitting  assignment

* Your solutions must be **typed** and **submitted in PDF format**, either using Latex of not.
* Your solutions must be clearly reasoned, or **you might lose some or all points even if your results are correct**, especially for those problems without fixed solutions.
* I encourage collaborative teamwork, whether with your classmates or with others onlines, but eventually you have to **write in your own tone**. No mercy for plagiarism.
* Sometimes you will get a special "θ" points on a problem. It means that I can interpret your solution in various angles, which is correct in one way but completely wrong in another. I will give you an opportunity to hypnotize me that you are right orally.

## :mask: Adjustments for Distance Learning (if necessary)

* Roll call: A form will be sent during each lecture session such that you have to fill in a passcode exposed by Professor Sun in that session along with your name and student ID.
* Exams: The exams will be opened-book but with much harder problems.
* Grading:

  Activity | Percentage
  ---------|------------
  Midterm  | 20%  
  Final Exam | 20%
  Homeworks | 60%
